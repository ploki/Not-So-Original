== Not So Original

A wonderful image gallery powered by libapache2-mod-raii

== WTF is NotSoOriginal ?

* NotSoOriginal is not O.R.I.G.I.N.A.L. (I borrowed Jimmac's graphics)
* NotSoOriginal is a bunch of C++ code lines to get your photos on the web.
* The aim of NotSoOriginal is to handle your directories of digital photos without extra files for comment and descriptions.
* Therefor you can put photographs in the directory with DAV or directly with your digital still camera/scanner.
* Preview and thumbnails are auto generated when you first hit a new or updated image.
* You can create albums and link photo to them - virtual directory and photos.
* You can create pass to grant acces to public to specifics directories
* It handles anonymous, granted and privileged users.
* You can configure your directories as public, private or hidden.
* View and download counts, Comment and description.
* All persisting stuffs are stored in one sqlite or PostgreSQL database.
* Automatic or processed raw conversion. It's a true digital laboratory which makes it possible to precisely develop you raw photographs.
* Lossless online photograph manipulation operators stacks which are saved in database.
* Pour les franÃ§ais, vous pouvez envoyer les photos qui vous plaisent chez PHOTO-SERVICE pour tirage
